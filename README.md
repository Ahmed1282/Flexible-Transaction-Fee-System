# Flexible Transaction Fee System

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines the requirements for a flexible transaction fee system that enables the configuration of fees for various events in our application.

### Scope
The system will provide administrators with the ability to define flexible fee structures based on transaction types, user segments, and specific use cases.

### Objectives
- Enable seamless fee configuration to align with business strategies and user needs.
- Enhance user experience by offering personalized fee structures.

## Overview

### Description
The Flexible Transaction Fee System is pivotal in our application infrastructure, facilitating dynamic fee configurations to optimize user interactions.

### Importance of Configurable Fee Structures
Flexible fee configurations allow us to adapt to market dynamics, incentivize desired behaviors, and differentiate our services.

### Target Users and Audience
- **Administrators**: Admins for managing fee structures.
- **End Users**: Customers who will experience the fee structures during their interactions with the application.

## Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Fee Configuration

#### Event Types
- Deposit
- Buy
- Swap
- Sell
- Send
- Withdraw

#### Configurable Fee Options

- **Transaction Thresholds**:
  - Waive charges on the first transaction.
  - Charge on subsequent transactions.
  - Waive charges on a specific number of initial transactions.
  - Charge after the specified number of transactions.

- **User Segments**:
  - Apply discounted fees for selected user segments (e.g., repeat users, inactive customers).
  - Configure fees for new customers.
  - Configure fees for customers who have remained inactive for a specified duration.

- **Jurisdictions**:
  - Configure fees based on different jurisdictions (LB, UAE, Indonesia, Global).
  - Allow toggling of fee configurations for each jurisdiction.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Create promotional campaigns with waived fees for new users.
  - Offer reduced fees for specific transaction types or amounts during limited-time promotions.
  - Implement tiered fee structures based on user activity levels or account balances.
  - Set custom fee configurations for partner integrations or white-label solutions.

- **Duration-Based Fees**:
  - Configure fees to apply for a certain duration (e.g., promotional periods, seasonal discounts).
  - Allow multiple event types to be selected simultaneously for fee configurations.

### 3.2. Advanced Configuration Options

- **Discounted Fees**:
  - Apply percentage-based or fixed-amount discounts on fees for specific user segments or transaction types.

- **Activity-Based Fees**:
  - Configure different fees for active vs. inactive users based on defined activity thresholds.

- **Combination Fees**:
  - Allow for complex configurations where multiple criteria (e.g., user segment, transaction type, duration, jurisdiction) are combined to determine the applicable fee.

### Best Practice Scenarios

- **Loyalty Rewards**: Offer progressively lower fees for users who complete a certain number of transactions within a set timeframe.
- **Retention Campaigns**: Waive or discount fees for users identified as at risk of churn based on inactivity or reduced engagement.
- **Volume Discounts**: Implement lower fees for high-volume traders to encourage larger transaction sizes.
- **Regional Pricing**: Customize fees based on geographic regions (jurisdictions) to reflect local market conditions and competition.

## Epic: Implement Flexible Transaction Fee System

### Epic Description
As an administrator, I want to configure flexible transaction fees for various events, user segments, and jurisdictions, enabling dynamic fee structures to adapt to business strategies and user needs.

### Acceptance Criteria
- The system allows configuration of fees for different transaction types (Deposit, Buy, Swap, Sell, Send, Withdraw).
- Administrators can set fee configurations based on user segments (e.g., new customers, inactive customers, high-volume traders).
- Administrators can set fee configurations based on jurisdictions (LB, UAE, Indonesia, Global).
- Fee configurations can include transaction thresholds (e.g., waive fees on the first three transactions).
- Fees can be configured for specific durations (e.g., promotional periods).
- Multiple event types can be selected simultaneously for fee configurations.
- Discounts can be applied to fees for specific user segments or transaction types.

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions
- Users will adhere to fee structures without exploiting loopholes or vulnerabilities.
- Adequate resources will be allocated for system development, testing, and maintenance.

### Constraints
- Regulatory limitations may restrict certain fee configurations in specific jurisdictions or industries.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### Risks
- Incorrect fee calculations leading to financial loss or user dissatisfaction.
- Security breaches compromising sensitive fee configuration data.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Conduct thorough testing of fee calculation algorithms and scenarios to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Implement encryption, access controls, and audit trails to protect fee configuration data from unauthorized access or tampering.

## Technical Architecture

### Components
- **Backend**: Fee management engine responsible for applying configured fee structures.
- **Database**: Stores fee configuration data and transaction history.
